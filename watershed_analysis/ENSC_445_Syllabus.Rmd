**Instructor**: Dr. Tim Covino 

**Class times**: T 14:00 – 15:15; Th 14:00 – 15:15

**Office hours**: W 14:00 - 15:15; or by appointment

**Website**: https://tpcovino.github.io/Git_home/watershed_analysis/index.html

<br>
**Course overview and objectives**: (1) provide theoretical understanding and practical experience with the most common analysis and modeling techniques relevant to watershed hydrology; and (2) provide training in analyzing, simulating, and presenting scientific data in written and oral formats.

<br>
**Approach**: This class will be largely hands-on, and students will be conducting watershed analyses and modeling exercises. We will follow a typical weekly format of Tuesday in-class lecture, Thursday hands-on computational work, and time spent working through online modules outside of class. The online modules are required and are intended to prepare students for the in-class work during lab on Thursday. Accordingly, this class will follow a semi-flipped format that includes in-class lecture, at-home lecture and exercises, and in-class work sessions. 

<br>
**Course structure**: Tuesday lectures will provide theoretical understanding and Thursday computing labs will be focused on skill development in watershed analysis and modeling. Labs will typically be due the Friday following the Thursday work session (i.e., 8-days following in-class session).

**Tentative schedule, subject to change**:

Week 1: Introduction, overview and technical skills.

Week 2: Watershed boundaries, delineation and terrain analysis.

Week 3: Hydrologic processes, climate and water balance. Trend detection and analysis, non-parametric approaches.

Week 4: Statistical vs process-based models and their implementation. 

Week 5: Surface water: Rating curves, hydrographs, frequency analysis and modeling approaches.

Week 6: Precipitation variability, interpolation schemes and data sources.

Week 7: Evapotranspiration, physical processes, and modeling approaches.

Week 8: Spring break.

Week 9: Term project overview, project brainstorm, identify data/models necessary to complete project.

Week 10: Groundwater, physical processes, data availability, and modeling approaches. 

Week 11: Erosional processes and modeling.

Week 12: Water quality: analysis and prediction.

Week 13: Land cover change, remote sensing, and implications for watershed hydrology.

Week 14: Writing as rewriting.
