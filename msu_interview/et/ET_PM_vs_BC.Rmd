# Summary

Evapotranspiration (ET) refers to the combined losses of water from the land surface to the atmosphere via evaporation and transpiration. Transpiration is loss of water from plants to the atmosphere and often accounts for a majority of total ET [(Wei et al., 2017)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL072235). Due to challenges in measuring ET, many estimation approaches have been developed. In this lab we will use two common methods: the Blaney-Criddle and FAO-56 Penman-Monteith approaches to estimating ET. Please work through the lab, including required readings and videos, up to the synthesis questions prior to lab on Thursday. During Thursday lab we will work on modeling ET in R and I will get you started on the project. You are welcome to collaborate with your colleagues in class but all work submitted and all responses must be your own.

## Overall learning objectives

At the end of this module, students will understand the key processes driving evaporation and transpiration. Additionally, students will estimate ET using the Blaney-Criddle and FAO-56 Penman-Monteith methods, evaluate differences in ET between sites of different climates, identify how the two ET models differ, and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each.

### Understanding ET in irrigated systems is important becaue the large majority of water used globally is for irrigation. See [Qin et al., (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0746-8){target="_blank"} for suplemental reading on changing snowmelt and irrigated agriculture.

# Modeling reference ET

### Blaney-Criddle

Blaney-Criddle is a relatively simplistic model compared to Penman-Monteith, which is explained below. Blaney-Criddle is commonly used when meteorological data are unavailable and calculates evapotranspiration for a reference crop using mean monthly temperature. 

$ET_o$ = $p$ (0.46 $Tmean$ + 8) 

where, ET$_o$ is reference ET (mm day^-1^) as an average for a one month period, $p$ is the mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours, and $Tmean$ is mean daily temperature (°C). 

The mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours, p, is calculated based on the latitude of the site.

###  Penman-Monteith

The Penman approach is an energy balance and mass transfer method to estimate evaporation from open water, bare soil, and grass using climatological data as input:

![](images/Penman_1.png){width=40%}

Where, $λE$ is evaporative latent heat flux (MJ m^-2^ d^-1^), $Δ$ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve, $R_n$ is net radiation flux (MJ m^-2^ d^-1^), $G$ is ground heat flux (MJ m^-2^ d^-1^), $γ$ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C^-1^), and $E_a$ is the vapor flux (mm d^-1^) (2)

Including a bulk surface resistance term, Montieth further modified Penman (using daily values):

![](images/Penman_2.png){width=50%}

Where, $ρa$ is air density (kg m^-3^), $C_p$ is the specific heat of dry air (J kg^-1^ K^-1^), $e_s$ is saturated vapor pressure (kPa), $e_a$ is ambient vapor pressure (kPa), $r_av$ is bulk surface aerodynamic resistance for water vapor (s m^-1^), and $r_s$ is the canopy surface resistance (s m^-1^).

Lastly, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recommended a simplified version, the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation, by assuming some constant parameters for a clipped grass reference crop:

![](images/FAO-56.png){width=50%}

Where, $ET_o$ is reference ET (mm day^-1^), T is temperature (^o^C), and $u_2$ is wind speed (m s^-1^) at 2 m above the ground.

###  Sites

We will use 2 SCAN sites that have the necessary data to complete this analysis. We will use each method described above to estimate $ET_o$ for Florida (2009) and Montana (808) SCAN sites. Accordingly, we will be evaluating differences in model estimates across widely differening climate. 


###  Analysis

In lab on Thursday I will demonstrate the basic approaches to modeling $ET_o$ using the Blaney-Criddle and FAO-56 Penman-Monteith approaches using R Studio. I will not give you all of the code to do so, but I will give you the building blocks from which you will be able complete the project.

7. Use your background understanding and modeling results to discuss under which environmental and meteorological conditions you think the models would provide similar estimates and under which conditions they would diverge. (10 points)
